                <p>Early life
                    Sambhaji was born at Purandar fort. He was 17 years old when his father Shivaji was crowned in 1674.He lost his mother Saibai who was Shivaji's favourite wife at the age of 2.Since then he was under the care of his grandmother. His grandmother and mentor Jijabai died in the same year of the coronation of Shivaji. Sambhaji was taken as security by Mughal sardar Mirjha raja Jayasingh until he receives all forts of agreement which Shivaji Maharaj did with him to stop his attack on maratha kingdom under his control. Sambhaji was 9 years old at that time.
                    In a marriage of political alliance, Sambhaji was married to a minor Jivubai, renamed (as per Maratha custom) Yesubai, daughter of Pilajirao Shirke who came to service of Shivaji Maharaj after defeat of a powerful Deshmukh he was serving.Thus giving Shivaji access to the Konkan coastal belt.
                    Coronation
                    Annaji Datto, Somaji Datto and some others in Shivaji's court wanted to oust Sambhaji to enhance their own positions and power in the affairs of the state and use it to their advantage. They poisoned Sambhaji's food but Sambhaji was fortunately saved as the plot was uncovered. Sambhaji forgave them. Still, they conspired again and wanted to arrest Sambhaji at the Panhala Fort, where he was staying at the time of Shivaji's death. They wanted to crown his minor stepbrother, Rajaram as Maratha king and wanted take full control over Maratha Kingdom. Rajaram's mother, Soyarabai, was involved in the plan. However the Supreme Commander of Maratha forces, Hambirrao Mohite, who was Soyarbai's brother, supported Sambhaji as the rightful heir to the throne. It was chiefly because of Hambirrao Mohite's support that Sambhaji was able to ascend to the throne in 1681. Sambhaji pardoned all involved in plan and reappointed Moropant Pingale Peshwa. </p>

                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Sambhaji was the son of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, the first ruler/Chhatrapati of the Maratha Empire and his first wife Saibai.</li>
                    <li>After Saibai’s death (1659), it is said that he was raised by Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj’s mother Jijabai. When he was nine years of age, he was sent to live as a political hostage at the palace of Raja Jai Singh I of Amber. Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj had to do this as surety that he would comply with the Treaty of Purandar he signed with the Mughals in 1665.</li>
                    <li>Sambhaji was thus a Mansabdar of the Mughals. In 1666, Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj and Sambhaji presented themselves at the court of the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb. Aurangzeb put the duo under house arrest. Two months later, father and son escaped.</li>
                    <li>Both sides reconciled following which there was a brief period of friendship between 1666 and 1670. During this period, Sambhaji fought alongside his father to support the Mughals against the Bijapur Sultan.</li>
                    <li>After Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj died in April 1680, there were attempts by some ministers in the Maratha court to crown Sambhaji’s half-brother Rajaram as the king. Rajaram was Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj’s second son from his wife Soyarabai.</li>
                    <li>Sambhaji was a scholar in Marathi and a few other languages as well. He authored a Sanskrit book Budhbhushanam. This poetic work is on politics where he discusses military tactics and the do’s and don’t’s for rulers. He also wrote books in Hindi such as Saatsatak, Nayikabhed and Nakhshikha.</li>
